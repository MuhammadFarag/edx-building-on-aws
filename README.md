# AWS Developer: Building on AWS - edx course exercises

## Exercise 3
* I have modified the CloudFocmation template provided in the course from JSON to YAML to make it less verbose and easier to reason about.
* If you are using an intelliJ based IDE, there is a [plugin](https://github.com/shalupov/idea-cloudformation) that makes working with CloudFocmation file a little bit easier (just a little bit).
* Bootstrap script was provided as a text file. I have changed it to bash file just to make it easier in the IDE.
